        If you used automatic partitioning, you can either accept the current
        partition settings (click <b>Next</b>), or modify the
        setup using the manual partitioning tool.
      </p><p>
        If you are manually partitioning your system, you will see your current
        hard drive(s) and partitions displayed below. Use the partitioning tool
        to add, edit, or delete partitions for your system.
      </p><p>
        Note, you must create a root (<b>/</b>) partition before
        you can proceed with this installation. If you do not create a root
        partition, the installation program will not know where to install
        @RHL@.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="s2-help-screens-disksetup"></a>Partitioning</h3></div></div><p>
The graphical representation of your hard drive(s) allows you to see how much
space has been dedicated to the various partitions created.
</p><p>
	Below the graphical representation, you will see a file system hierarchy
	showing your existing partitions. Using your mouse, click once to
	highlight a partition or double-click the partition to edit it.

	  actions.  You can add, edit, and delete partitions here. In addition,
	  there are buttons you can use to accept the changes you have made, or
	  to reset and exit the partitioning tool.
	</p><p><tt>New:</tt> Use this button to create a new partition.
	   A dialog box will appear containing fields that must be filled in
	   (such as mount point, file system type, drive that the partition
	   should exist on, size, and so on).
	</p><p><tt>Edit:</tt> Use this button to change the mount point
	  of a currently selected partition. You can also manually create a
	  partition by editing free space (if available). Editing free space in
	  this sense is similar to using <tt>parted</tt> in
	  that you can choose where the partition begins and ends within that
	  free space.
	</p><p><tt>Delete:</tt> Use this button to delete a partition.
	</p><p><tt>Reset:</tt> Use this button to cancel your changes.
	</p><p><tt>RAID:</tt> Use the <b>RAID</b>
	   button ONLY if you have experience using RAID. 
	   To make a RAID
	   device, you must first create software RAID partitions. Once you have
	   created two or more software RAID partitions, select
	   <b>RAID</b> to join the software RAID partitions into
	   a RAID device.
	 </p><p><tt>LVM:</tt> Use the <b>LVM</b> button
	   ONLY if you have experience using LVM. 
	   To create an LVM logical
	   volume, you must first create partitions of type physical volume
	   (LVM). Once you have created one or more physical volume (LVM)
	   partitions, select <b>LVM</b> to create an LVM logical
	   volume.</p><p><b>Hide RAID device/LVM Volume Group members</b>:
	Select this option if you do not want to view any RAID device or LVM
	Volume Group members that have been created.</p></div></div></body></html>
