        Choose where you would like @RHL@ to be installed.
      </p><p>
        If you used automatic partitioning, you can either accept the current
        partition settings (click <b>Next</b>), or modify the
        setup using Disk Druid, the manual partitioning tool.
      </p><p>
        If you are manually partitioning your system (using Disk Druid), you
        will see your current hard drive(s) and partitions displayed below. Use
        the partitioning tool to add, edit, or delete partitions for your
        system.
      </p><p>
        Note, you must create a root (<b>/</b>) partition before
        you can proceed with this installation. If you do not create a root
        partition, the installation program will not know where to install
        @RHL@. You must also create a <b>/boot/efi</b> partition
        of type vfat. The <b>/boot/efi</b> partition contains all
        the installed kernels, the initrd images, and ELILO configuration files.
      </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="s2-help-screens-disksetup-ia64"></a>Partitioning</h3></div></div><p>
The graphical representation of your hard drive(s) allows you to see how much
space has been dedicated to the various partitions created.
</p><p>
	Below the graphical representation, you will see a file system hierarchy
	showing your existing partitions. Using your mouse, click once to
	highlight a partition or double-click the partition to edit it.

	  The center row of buttons controls the partitioning tool's actions.
	  You can add, edit, and delete partitions here. In addition, there are
	  buttons you can use to accept the changes you have made, or to reset and
	  exit the partitioning tool.
	</p><p>
	  <tt>New:</tt> Use this button to create a new partition.  A
	   dialog box will appear containing fields that must be filled in (such
	   as mount point, file system type, drive that the partition should
	   exist on, size, and so on).
	</p><p>
	  <tt>Edit:</tt> Use this button to change the mount point of
	  a currently selected partition. You can also manually create a
	  partition by editing free space (if available). Editing free space in
	  this sense is similar to using <tt>parted</tt> in that you
	  can choose where the partition begins and ends within that free space.
	</p><p>
	  <tt>Delete:</tt> Use this button to delete a
	   partition. 
	</p><p>
	  <tt>Reset:</tt> Use this button to cancel your changes.
	</p><p>
	  <tt>RAID:</tt> Use the <b>Make RAID</b>
	   button ONLY if you have experience using RAID. 
	   To make a RAID
	   device, you must first create software RAID partitions. Once you have
	   created two or more software RAID partitions, select <b>Make
	   RAID</b> to join the software RAID partitions into a RAID
	   device.
	 </p><p><tt>LVM:</tt> Allows you to create an LVM logical
	  volume. The role of LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is to present a
	  simple logical view of underlying physical storage space, such as a
	  hard drive(s). LVM manages individual physical disks â€” or to be
	  more precise, the individual partitions present on them. <span class="emphasis"><em>It
	  should only be used if you have experience using LVM.</em></span>
