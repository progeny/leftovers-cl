        SILO, the Sparc Improved LOader, is the software that can be
        used to start @RHL@ on your computer. It can also
        start other operating systems, such as SunOS and
        Solaris. Here, you will be asked how (or whether) you want to
        configure SILO.
      </p><p>
        <b>Create boot disk</b>: You should create a
        boot disk if you are not installing SILO at all or if you want
        it for safety reasons.  If you do not have a floppy this option
        will be hidden, if you have a SMCC manufactured Ultra which
        usually do not have floppies which can be booted, this option
        will default to disabled.
      </p><p>
        <b>Do not install SILO</b>: You can choose to
        skip SILO if you do not want to write SILO to your drive,
        e.g. if you have SILO already installed on a different
        partition or disk and want to boot from there.
      </p><p>
        To install SILO, select where you want to install it. If your system
        will use only @RHL@ you should probably choose the Master Boot Record
        (Boot Block of the first partition on the disk). For systems where
        SunOS/Solaris and @RHL@ will reside on a single hard drive, you should
        probably not install SILO into the MBR, especially if SunOS/Solaris is
        on the first partition of the disk.
      </p><p>
        If you choose not to install SILO for ANY reason, please make
        a boot disk so you can boot @RHL@.
      </p><p>
        <b>Create PROM alias</b>: The installation program can
        create a PROM alias &quot;linux&quot; if the PROM supports it, so that you can
        boot into the SILO boot loader from the PROM command line by the command
        &quot;boot linux&quot;.
      </p><p>
        <b>Set default PROM boot device</b>: The installation
        program can make sure the PROM will boot by default into the @RHL@
        installation program by setting PROM option &quot;boot-device&quot; or
        &quot;boot-from&quot;.
      </p><p>
       If you wish to add default options to the SILO boot command, enter them
       into the kernel parameters field.  Any options you enter will be passed
       to the Linux kernel every time it boots.
      </p><p>
       Bootable Partition - Every bootable partition is listed and labeled,
       including partitions used by other operating systems. If you would like
       to add boot labels for other partitions (or change existing boot
       labels), click once on the partition to select it. Once selected, you
       can change the boot label.
