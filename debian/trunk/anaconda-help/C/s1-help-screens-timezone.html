	You can set your time zone either by selecting your computer's physical
	location, or by your time zone's offset from Universal Time, Coordinated.
	(also known as UTC).
      </p><p>
	Notice the two tabs at the top of the screen. The first tab offers you
	the ability to configure by location.
      </p><p>
	From the interactive map, you can click on a specific city, as indicated
	by the yellow dots, and a red <b>X</b> will appear at your
	selection.
      </p><p>
	You can also scroll through the city list and choose your desired time
	zone.
      </p><p>
	The second tab offers you the ability to use the Universal Time,
	Coordinated (UTC) offset.  Here, you will find a list of offsets for you
	to choose from, as well as an option to set daylight saving time.
      </p><p>
	For both tabs, there is the option of selecting <b>System Clock
	  uses UTC</b>. (UTC, also known as GMT, will allow your system
	  to properly handle daylight-saving time.) Please select this if your
	computer's hardware clock is set to UTC (instead of being set to your
	local time).
