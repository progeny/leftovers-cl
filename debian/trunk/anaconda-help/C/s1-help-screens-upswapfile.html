Upgrading your swap partition is not necessary for all upgrades. You have
reached this screen because the installation program has determined you
do not have enough memory to continue with the installation.
</p><p>
Here you can choose to create a swap file on your hard disk. The swap file is
treated as virtual memory and enhances the performance of your system.
</p><p>
If you do not want to create a swap file during this upgrade, you may want to
consider aborting the installation and creating the necessary file on your own.
</p><p>
To create a swap file, select the button beside <b>Create a swap
file</b>.
</p><p>
Next, using your mouse, select the partition where the swap file will reside. 
</p><p>
Enter the size of the swap file (in MB) in the field provided.
