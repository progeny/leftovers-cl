       By performing an upgrade, you can migrate (or convert) your existing ext2
       file system to an ext3 file system. This operation will preserve your
       existing files.</p><p>The advantage of migrating to ext3 is that you will have journaling
       file system capabilities.  The ext3 file system do not have to be fscked
       after an unexpected reboot, unlike the ext2 file system. This can
       drastically reduce the amount of time for the system to come back up and
       be ready to use.</p><p>It is therefore recommended that you choose to convert your
       file systems.</p><p>To do so, select the partitions to migrate to ext3.</p><p>When you are done, click <b>Next</b> to move
      forward.</p></div></body></html>
