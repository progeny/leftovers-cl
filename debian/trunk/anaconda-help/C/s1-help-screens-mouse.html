       Choose the correct mouse type for your system.
      </p><p>
	Do you have a PS/2, USB, Bus or serial mouse?  (Hint: If the connector your
	mouse plugs into is round, it is a PS/2 or a Bus mouse; if
	rectangular, it is a USB mouse; if trapezoidal, it is a serial mouse.)
      </p><p>
	Try to find an exact match.  If an exact match cannot be found, choose
	one which is compatible with yours. Otherwise, choose the appropriate
	<b>Generic</b> mouse type.
      </p><p>
	If you have a serial mouse, pick the device and port it is connected to
	in the next box.
      </p><p><b>Tip</b>: If you have a scroll mouse, select the MS
      IntelliMouse entry (with your proper mouse port) as the compatible mouse
      type.</p><p>
	In @RHL@, the graphical environment (X Window System) is designed to
	make use of a three-button mouse.  If you have a two-button mouse,
	select the <b>Emulate 3 buttons</b> option. After the
	installation, you can click both mouse buttons at once to act as the
	middle mouse button.
