        Choose whether you would like to perform a full installation or an
        upgrade.
      </p><p>
	A full installation will destroy any previously saved information on the
	selected partitions.
      </p><p>
	An upgrade will preserve existing @RHL@ system data.
      </p><p>
	If you want to perform a full installation, you must choose the class
	(or type) of the installation. Your options (Workstation, Server,
	or Custom) are discussed briefly below.
      </p><p>
        A workstation installation will create a system for your home or desktop
        use. A graphical, Windows-like environment will be installed. This
        option is not recommended for zSeries systems.
       </p><p>
	If you want your system to function as a Linux-based server, and do not
	want to heavily customize your system configuration or install the X
	Window System (a graphical environment), a server system installation is
	most appropriate. The server class installation is the preferred type of
	installation for zSeries systems.
      </p><p>
	Only the custom system installation gives you complete flexibility. You
	have complete control over the packages that will be installed on your
	system. Unless you have prior Linux experience, you should not select
	the custom-class installation method.
