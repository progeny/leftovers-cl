A firewall sits between your computer and the network, and determines which
resources on your computer remote users on the network are able to access. A
properly configured firewall can greatly increase the out-of-the-box security of
your system.
</p><p>
Choose the appropriate security level for your system.
</p><p><b>High Security</b> - By choosing <b>High
	Security</b>, your system will not accept connections that are
	not explicitly defined by you. By default, only the following
	connections are allowed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>DNS replies</p></li><li><p>DHCP - so any network interfaces that use DHCP can
	    be properly configured.</p></li></ul></div><p>
	Using this <b>High Security</b> will not allow the
	following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Active mode FTP (Passive mode FTP, used by default in
	      most clients, should work fine.)</p></li><li><p>IRC DCC file transfers</p></li><li><p>RealAudio(tm)</p></li><li><p>Remote X Window System clients</p></li></ul></div><p>If you are connecting your system to the Internet, but do not plan
	to run a server, this is the safest choice. If additional services are
	needed, you can choose <b>Customize</b> to allow
	specific services through the firewall.
      </p><p><b>Medium Security</b> - Choosing <b>Medium
	  Security</b> will not allow your system to have access to certain
	resources. By default, access to the following resources are not allowed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Ports lower than 1023 - these are the standard reserved ports,
	    used by most system services, such as
	    <b>FTP</b>, <b>SSH</b>,
	    <b>telnet</b>, and
	    <b>HTTP</b>.</p></li><li><p>NFS server port (2049)</p></li><li><p>The local X Window System display for remote X clients</p></li><li><p>The X Font server port (This is disabled by default in the
	    font server.)</p></li></ul></div><p>If you want to allow resources such as
	<b>RealAudio(tm)</b>, while still blocking access to
	normal system services, choose <b>Medium
	  Security</b>. You can choose <b>Customize</b> to
	allow specific services through the firewall.
      </p><p><b>No Firewall</b> - No firewall allows complete
	access and does no security checking. It is recommended that this only
	be selected if you are running on a trusted network (not the Internet),
	or if you plan to do more detailed firewall configuration later.
      </p><p>Unless you plan to customize your firewall, make sure
      <b>Use default firewall rules</b> is selected.</p><p>Choose <b>Customize</b> to add trusted devices or to
      allow additional incoming interfaces.</p><p><b>Trusted Devices</b> - Checking these for any of
	your devices allows all traffic coming from that device to be allowed.
      </p><p>It is not recommended to enable this for devices that are connected
	to public networks, such as the Internet.</p><p><b>Allow Incoming</b> - Enabling these options allow
	the specified services to pass through the firewall. Note, during a
	workstation-class installation, the majority of these services are
	<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> present on the system.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b>WWW (HTTP)</b> -
	    <b>HTTP</b> is the protocol used by
	    <b>Apache</b> to serve Web pages. If you plan on
	    making your Web server publicly available, enable this option.
	  </p></li><li><p><b>FTP</b> - <b>FTP</b> is a
	    protocol used for remote file transfer. If you plan on making your
	    <b>FTP</b> server publicly available, enable
	    this option.</p></li><li><p><b>SSH</b> - Secure Shell
	    (<b>SSH</b>) is a protocol for logging into and
	    executing commands on remote machines. It provides secure encrypted
	    communications.</p></li><li><p><b>DHCP</b> - This allows DHCP queries and
	    replies, and allows any network interfaces that use DHCP determine
	    their IP address. DHCP is normally enabled.</p></li><li><p><b>Mail (SMTP)</b> - This allows incoming SMTP
	    mail delivery. If you need to allow remote hosts to connect directly
	    to your machine to deliver mail, enable this option. Do not enable
	    this if you collect your mail from your ISP's server by POP3 or
	    IMAP, or if you use a tool such as
	    <b>fetchmail</b>. Note that an improperly
	    configured SMTP server can allow remote machines to use your server
	    to send spam.</p></li><li><p><b>Telnet</b> -
	    <b>Telnet</b> is a protocol for logging into
	    remote machines. It is unencrypted, and provides little security
	    from network snooping attacks.
	  </p></li></ul></div><p><b>Other ports</b> - You can specify that other
	ports not listed here be allowed through the firewall. The format to use
	is 'port:protocol' (for example, nfs:udp for a single port or
	nfs:udp,gopher:tcp for multiple ports).</p></div></body></html>
