	Choose your network card and whether you would like to configure using
	DHCP.  If you have multiple Ethernet devices, each device will have its
	own configuration screen.  You can switch between device screens, (for
	example eth0 and eth1); the information you give will be specific to
	each screen. If you select <b>Activate on boot</b>, your
	network card will be started when you boot.
      </p><p>
	If you do not have DHCP client access or are unsure as to what this
	information is, please contact your Network Administrator.
      </p><p>
	Next enter, where applicable, the IP Address, Netmask, Network,
	Broadcast, and Point to Point addresses. If you are unsure about any of
	these, contact your Network Administrator.
      </p><p>
        Note: Point to Point addresses are used for configuring
        point-to-point connections for CTC and ESCON devices.
      </p><p>
	Enter in a hostname for your system. If you do not, your system will be
	known as &quot;localhost.&quot;
      </p><p>
	Finally, enter the Gateway address and the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary DNS
	addresses.
