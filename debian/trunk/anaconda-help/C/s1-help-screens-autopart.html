Automatic partitioning allows you to have some control concerning what data is
removed (if any) from your system.
</p><p>
To remove only Linux partitions (partitions created from a previous Linux
installation), select <b>Remove all Linux partitions on this
system</b>.
</p><p>
To remove all partitions on your hard drive(s) (this includes partitions created
by other operating systems such as Windows 95/98/NT/2000), select
<b>Remove all partitions on this system</b>.
</p><p>
To retain your current data and partitions, assuming you have enough free space
available on your hard drive(s), select <b>Keep all partitions and use
existing free space</b>.
</p><p>
Using your mouse, choose the hard drive(s) you want @RHL@ to be installed on. If
you have multiple hard drives, you can choose which hard drive(s) should contain
this installation. Unselected hard drives, and any data on them, will not be
touched.
</p><p>
You can review and make any necessary changes to the partitions created by
automatic partitioning by selecting the <b>Review</b> option.
</p><p>
Select <b>Next</b> to proceed.
