        Select where you want the boot loader to be installed. If your system
        will use only @RHL@, select the Master Boot Record (MBR). For
        systems on which Win95/98 and @RHL@ will reside on a single hard drive,
        you should also install the boot loader to the MBR.
      </p><p>
        If you have Windows NT (and you want a boot loader to be installed) you
        should choose to install it on the first sector of the boot
        partition. 
      </p><p>Click <b>Change Drive Order</b> to rearrange the
      drive order. Changing the drive order may be useful if you have multiple
      SCSI adapters or both SCSI and IDE adapters and want to boot from the SCSI
      device.</p><p>Select <b>Force LBA32</b> if you have experienced
	problems with the system using LBA32 support during previous
	installations; for example, the system may need to exceed the 1024
	cylinder limit for the <tt>/boot</tt> partition. Only if you
	have a system which supports the LBA32 extension for booting operating
	systems above the 1024 cylinder limit, and you want to place your
	<tt>/boot</tt> partition above cylinder 1024, should you
	select this option. If you are unsure, do not select the <b>Force
	LBA32</b> option.</p><p>
        If you wish to add default options to the boot command, enter them into
        the <b>General kernel parameters</b> field.  Any options
        you enter will be passed to the Linux kernel every time it boots.
