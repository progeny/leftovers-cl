	Any network devices you have on the system will be automatically
	detected by the installation program and shown in the <b>Network
	Devices</b> list.</p><p>To configure the network device, first select the device and then
	click <b>Edit</b>. In the <b>Edit
	Interface</b> screen, you can choose to have the IP and Netmask
	information configured by DHCP or you can enter it manually. You can
	also choose to make the device active at boot time.</p><p>
	If you do not have DHCP client access or are unsure as to what this
	information is, please contact your Network Administrator.
      </p><p>
	If your system is
	part of a larger network where hostnames are assigned by DHCP, select
	<b>automatically via DHCP</b>.  Otherwise, select
	<b>manually</b> and enter in a hostname for your
	system. If you do not, your system will be known as &quot;localhost.&quot;
      </p><p>
	Finally, if you entered the IP and Netmask information manually, you may
	also enter the Gateway address and the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary
	DNS addresses.
