        Choose what type of installation you would like to perform. Your options
	(<span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Server</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom</em></span>)
	are discussed briefly below.
      </p><p>An <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Server</em></span> installation is specifically
        targeted at server installations capable of high levels of availability
        through load balancing and failover capacities. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced
        Server</em></span> configuration includes, at your option, the ability to
        install a default X Window System environment with management, as well
        as the necessary components for clustering together two or more systems
        to achieve higher levels of performance to meet the demands of high
        performance server environments.</p><p>Choosing the <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom</em></span> installation gives you
        complete flexibility. You have complete control over the packages that
        will be installed on your system. You can also determine whether you
        will use GRUB to boot your system. Unless you have prior Linux
        experience, you should not select the <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom</em></span>
        installation method.
