Description: Componentized Linux Platform Development Kit (PDK)
 Componentized Linux is a platform for building specialized Linux
 distributions.  Componentized Linux provides developers with a set of
 reusable building blocks, called components, which can be easily assembled
 into a wide variety of configurations and customized as necessary.  It
 combines this componentized platform with a set of technologies (covering
 installation, software management, and hardware detection, with more on the
 way) that span traditional distribution boundaries and transform the
 assembled components into a complete distribution.
 .
 This package contains the Componentized Linux Platform Development Kit (PDK).
 Essentially, you can think of the PDK as "version control for
 distributions"--it's intended to be a full suite of tools for building and
 maintaining a CL-based distribution, from assembling a full distro from a set
 of pre-built components to managing the evolution of the distro over time to
 incorporate upstream changes to building your own custom components to
 specifying global configuration like branding to integrating distro-specific
 patches and managing the changes over time.
