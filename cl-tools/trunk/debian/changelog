cl-tools (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split cl-tools into two packages: cl-tools, for the end-user tools;
    and cl-tools-dev, for the development tools.

  * Added update-sources.list, a tool for updating /etc/apt/sources.list
    with sources.list fragments from /etc/apt/sources.list.d.

cl-tools (1.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version.

  * comp2repo.py: Fix bug in code that determines the name of the
    component repository.

cl-tools (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version.

  * comp2repo.py: Store the cached Packages and Sources files in
    $HOME/.cl-tools rather than /var/cache/cl-tools, to avoid
    permission problems.

  * comp2repo.py: Allow comps.xml to contain multiple "group"
    elements. In essence, this allows a single component *repository*
    to contain multiple components, and will be used to
    provide optional development and internationalization components.

cl-tools (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version.

  * comp2repo.py: Overwrite the cached Packages and Sources files
    rather than append to them.

  * debootstrap-script: Remove references to ipchains and libgdmg1,
    which have been removed from the core component.

cl-tools (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version.

  * Rename cl debootstrap script to "debootstrap-script".

  * debootstrap-script: Applied patch from Jeff Licquia to remove
    bogus Postfix configuration from base CL tarball.

  * Added comp2repo from Progeny subversion. Main changes are:

    - Rather than specifying the full sources.list on the command line
    *every time*, comp2repo now identifies upstream repos by a string.
    So, for example, you now say, simply, "comp2repo ./comps.xml sarge"
    instead of "comp2repo ./comps.xml deb http://archive.progeny.com/debian
    sarge main" when you update a component.

    - comp2repo now stores the upstream Packages and Sources files in
    /var/cache/cl-tools. So, "comp2repo --update sarge URI DIST COMP" will
    download the Packages and Sources files associated with URI, DIST, and
    COMP and store them in /var/cache/cl-tools. The cache file names
    associate the URI, DIST, and COMP to the repo id, so you don't have to
    specify it when updating the components themselves (e.g., comp2repo
    --update sarge http://archive.progeny.com/debian sarge main results
    in a cache files named

        Packages.sarge.http%3A%2F%2Farchive.progeny.com%2Fdebian%2Fdists%2Fsarge%2Fmain

    and

        Sources.sarge.http%3A%2F%2Farchive.progeny.com%2Fdebian%2Fdists%2Fsarge%2Fmain

    respectively.

    - It is no longer required to specify "deb"--deb format is assumed.
    Previous versions didn't do anything with this anyway. We'll add in
    rpm support in a later version.

  * Added merge-comps. Renamed merge-comps compsmerge, so all cl-tools
    have a common prefix.

cl-tools (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. Includes /usr/lib/debootstrap/scripts/cl (and, thus,
    "Conflicts" with, "Provides" and "Replaces" debootstrap-script-cl.)
